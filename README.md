# Weather API Fetch Application
This is a simple web application that fetches and displays current weather data from a public API based on user input (city name). The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather information.

# Features
* Weather Search by City: Enter any city name, and the app fetches the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
* Dynamic Weather Icons: The app displays weather-related icons corresponding to the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
* Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully, such as when a city name is invalid or the API request fails.
